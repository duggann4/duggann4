#### ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on:
- Projects that aim to utilize data science for social good, especially in the realms of education, accessibility, and advocacy.
- Open-source initiatives that are focused on creating more inclusive and accessible technology.

#### ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with:
- Finding more datasets related to education and neurodiversity for my ongoing projects.
- Feedback on my code and design of data visualization.

#### ðŸ’¬ Ask me about:
- Anything related to data science, machine learning, or natural language processing.
- My experience as a paraeducator and how I integrate data science into educational settings.

#### ðŸ“« How to reach me:
- Best way to reach me is through [my email](mailto://duggann@wwu.edu).
