### 👋 Hi, I'm Noah!

I'm a Data Scientist with a B.S. in Data Science from Western Washington University. My work blends analytics, accessibility, and advocacy — with a focus on neurodiversity, disability rights, and public transit systems.

I bring experience from both research and production environments, and I’m passionate about using data to make systems more inclusive, efficient, and human-centered.
